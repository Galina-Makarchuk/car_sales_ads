### A web app for a car selection

__The goal of this project:__ build a web app that allows to select a car based on client's preferences.

__How it was done:__ 
- The original dataset was cleaned to remove duplicated values.
- The original dataset was preprocessed to replace missing values.
- The outliers were not removed from the cleaned dataset, because these values can be important in some cases.
- The app is built with the cleaned dataset.
