# A car selection web app

Project's goal: build an interactive web app that allows to choose a car based on client's preferences.

The URL of the app on Render: https://choose-your-dream-car.onrender.com

Steps:
- The original dataset was cleaned to remove duplicate values.
- The original dataset was preprocessed to replace missing values.
- The outliers were not removed from the cleaned dataset, because these values were important in some cases.
- The app is built with the cleaned dataset.

To launch this project on a local machine:
- clone this repository
- navigate into this project (use cd <repository_name> to enter the project directory)
- from the terminal run the command: streamlit run app.py
- choose the car of your dreams!
